# Remember in Ruby, symbols are basically Strings that canâ€™t change.
# You can recognize a symbol because it starts with a colon :.
# All of the following are symbols:
# :name
# :symbols_can_have_underscores
# :"symbols can be in quotes"

# Lets change the hash above to use symbols instead of strings.
# Syntax symbol with hash rocket:
# create hash here
new_tv = {
  :"screen size" => 50,
  :"price" => 300,
  :"brand" => "Samsung"
}

# Syntax symbol without hash rocket:
# create hash here
new_tv = {
  screen_size: 50,
  price: 300,
  brand: "Samsung"
}

# Memoization: Determines if the variable already exists and it cannot find it, it will create a new one.
